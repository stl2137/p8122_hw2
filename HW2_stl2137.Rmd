# Question 1 
We are interested in the causal effect of light at night on weight gain. Plot the outcome by treatment group. 

* DM= dark

* LD =dim

* LL =bright

```{r}
mice_dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = light, y = bm_gain)) + 
  geom_point()

mice_dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = light, y = bm_gain)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
